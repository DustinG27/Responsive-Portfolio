            I am originally from a background in film and media specializing in
            lighting, lighting design, and writing. I has always been my dream
            to work behind the camera and see how all my forvite films and shows
            were made. After a few years of freelancing I decided that I would
            rather have a stable job in one location.

            This is when I made the choice to jump straight into the programming
            world. I have always loved technology. One of my favorite hobbies is
            taking apart various electronics and building them again with
            different shells. Once I had a grasp on hardware I wanted to move
            onto software and the core of computer technology.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            From here, I would like to keep pursuing my hobbies and gaining more
            skills. Eventually, I will build a gaming cabnet from the ground up.

            I also love beer. I have brewed my own as well as worked in a
            brewery. I got to drink on the job while I worked! How cool is that
            shit? Low key nickname: Hop King.
